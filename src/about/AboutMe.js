            Hello! I'm Sara Martiri, a passionate and curious software
            developer.
          </h1>
          <p>
            With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end development, I’ve
            spent the last few years sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, Java, Angular, and React. My programming journey began
            with HTML and CSS, but creating interactive websites quickly sparked
            my passion for JavaScript. This led me to explore frameworks like
            Angular and React, both of which opened new doors to building
            seamless user experiences. Java Enthusiast Although I started in web
            development, my curiosity pushed me to server-side technologies,
            where I embraced Java. I love its versatility, from building
            scalable back-end systems to developing mobile apps. Whether it's
            designing sleek interfaces or constructing robust APIs, Java is a
            key tool in my toolkit. Framework Explorer Angular and React are my
            go-tos for building dynamic UIs. Angular’s structure is great for
            large applications, while React’s flexibility allows for highly
            customizable development. I thrive on leveraging both to create
            interactive and responsive apps. Problem Solver At the heart of my
            passion is problem-solving. Whether debugging or optimizing, I enjoy
            diving into complex challenges. My experience ranges from simple
            websites to full-scale web applications, contributing to my growing
            expertise. Lifelong Learner I constantly seek new technologies and
            best practices to stay current. Through courses, coding challenges,
            and open-source contributions, I’m always expanding my skills.
            Beyond Code Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring tech trends, AI
            advancements, or brainstorming my next project with a cup of coffee.
            If you’re looking for someone who loves coding, embraces challenges,
            and is eager to learn, let’s build something awesome together!
